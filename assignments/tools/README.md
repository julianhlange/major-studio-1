### The Gini coefficient is a measure of inequality. The coefficient can change in response to policy decisions, national and international events, and economic factors.

### Abstract
Line charts that visualize changes for many states with many data points over time are challenging to read.
The goal of this project is to create a tool for displaying changes in the Gini coefficient between any two (consecutive or non-consecutive) years.

### Features
* Select any two years between 1980 and 2016 to view the changes in Gini coefficient for all countries for which data are available
* Click on a country's dot to view all available data between 1980 and 2016
