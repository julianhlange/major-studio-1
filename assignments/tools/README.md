# A tool for displaying year-to-year changes in the Gini coefficient

### This visualization looks at Canada's Indian Residential School system -- a network of boarding schools and federal hostels throughout Canada from the mid 1800s until 1996 -- through the stories of survivors and the narrative of each school.

### Abstract
The Gini coefficient is a measure of inequality. The coeeficient can change in response to policy decisions, national and international events, and economic factors.

Line charts that visualize those changes for many states at a time are challenging to read. The goal of this project is to create a tool for displaying changes in the Gini coefficient between any two (consecutive or non-consecutive)
years.
